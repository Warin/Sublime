# LoremIpsum

An extension for Sublime Text 2.

It allow you to Insert Lorem Ipsum in the editor via menu items or keyboard shortcut.

Just press the shortcut key (Alt+Command+l on OSX, Control+Alt+l on Windows/Linux) to add Lorem Ipsum text. Keep pressing to add more.

Alternatively, select how much text you want from the menu item.

## Features

1. Uses only words from the original Lorem ipsum text.
2. Randomly generates text from selection of words
3. Always starts with `Lorem ipsum`
4. Leaves the inserted text un-selected, so you can insert some more straight away (rapid tapping to get as much lorem as you want)
5. Shortcut key, `Edit -> Text -> Lorem Ipsum...` sub-menu, and context menu activation
6. Variable size of text from just `a bit` to more than you can shake a stick at!

## Install

### Package Control

The easiest way to install this is with [Package Control](http://wbond.net/sublime\_packages/package\_control).

 * If you just went and installed Package Control, you probably need to restart Sublime Text 2 before doing this next bit.
 * Bring up the Command Palette (Command+Shift+p on OS X, Control+Shift+p on Linux/Windows).
 * Select "Package Control: Install Package" (it'll take a few seconds)
 * Select LoremIpsum when the list appears.

Package Control will automatically keep Git up to date with the latest version.
