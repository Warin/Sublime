# Sublime TODOs

A Sublime Text 2 plugin to extract and list TODO comments from open files and 
project folders.

Take a look at [this screencast](http://webdesign.tutsplus.com/tutorials/applications/quick-tip-streamline-your-todo-lists-in-sublime-text-2/) (courtesy of Shannon Huffman) for an overview.


# Install

The preferred method is to use the [Sublime Package Manager](http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control). Alternatively, checkout from github:

```sh
$ cd Sublime Text 2/Packages
$ git clone https://robcowie@github.com/robcowie/SublimeTODO.git
```

# Config

All plugin configuration must be placed in user or project-specific settings inside a `todo` object, for example;

```javascript
{
    // other user config ...
    "todo": {
        "patterns": {}
    }
}
```

See an example user settings file [here](https://gist.github.com/2049887).

## Adding comment patterns

Extraction uses regular expressions that return one match group 
representing the message. Default patterns are provided for `TODO`, `NOTE`, `FIXME` 
and `CHANGED` comments.
To override or provide more patterns, add `patterns` to user settings, e.g.

```javascript
"patterns": {
    "TODO": "TODO[\\s]*?:+(?P<todo>.*)$",
    "NOTE": "NOTE[\\s]*?:+(?P<note>.*)$",
    "FIXME": "FIX ?ME[\\s]*?:+(?P<fixme>\\S.*)$",
    "CHANGED": "CHANGED[\\s]*?:+(?P<changed>\\S.*)$"
}
```

Note that the pattern _must_ provide at least one named group which will be used to group the comments in results.

By default, searching is case insensitive. You can change this behaviour by adding 

    "case_insensitive": true

to the todo settings object.

## Excluding files and folders

Global settings `folder_exclude_patterns`, `file_exclude_patterns` and `binary_file_patterns` are excluded from search results.

To exclude further directories, add directory names (not glob pattern or regexp) to `folder_exclude_patterns` in todo settings:

```javascript
"todo": {
    "folder_exclude_patterns": [
        "vendor", 
        "tmp"
    ]
}
```

To add file excludes, add glob patterns to `file_exclude_patterns`:

```javascript
"file_exclude_patterns": [
    "*.css"
]
```


## Results title

Override the results view title by setting `result_title`

```javascript
"result_title": "TODO Results"
```

# Usage

`Show TODOs` command can be triggered from the command palette. No default 
key bindings are provided.

## Navigating results

Results can be navigated by keyboard and mouse:

 * `n`ext, `p`revious, `c`lear, `enter`
 * `alt-double click`

 Note that due to the lack of support for context in mousemaps right now,
 alt-double click will trigger in _any_ document, though it should be a no-op.
