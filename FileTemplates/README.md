# File Templates for SublimeText 2

This Package enables you and other Package Developers to include File Templates.
A File Template is basically a snippet, a filename, a default path and optional arguments.

## Installation

### Package Control

The easiest way to install this is with Package Control.

If you just went and installed Package Control, you probably need to restart Sublime Text 2 before doing this next bit.

- Bring up the Command Palette (Command+Shift+p on OS X, Control+Shift+p on Linux/Windows).
- Select "Package Control: Install Package" (it'll take a few seconds)
- Select FileTemplates when the list appears.

Package Control will automatically keep FileTemplates up to date with the latest version.

### Clone from GitHub

    git clone http://github.com/mneuhaus/SublimeFileTemplates

## Usage

Bring up the Command Palette and select "Create File From Template" or set up some key bindings as
explained below.


### Templates

The Templates are files with the extension ".file-template"

Here's a basic example 

```xml
<template>
  <!-- You can us this to specifiy the content for the Template -->
  <!-- <content><![CDATA[ ${0:Hello World} ]]></content> -->

  <!-- Or you set a path to a seperate Template File here -->
  <file>jQueryPlugin.js</file>

  <!-- The filename for the new File, you can use the arguments to make it dynamic -->
  <filename>jquery.$name.js</filename>

  <!-- Default Path to create the new file inside your current Project -->
  <!-- you can use the arguments to make it dynamic -->
  <path>js/</path>

  <!-- Optional: Add as much arguments as you need, they will be asked in the order specified -->
  <arguments>
    <name>Name:</name>
  </arguments>
</template>
```

## Key bindings

The plugin does not install any key bindings automatically. You can set up
your own key bindings like this:

    { "keys": ["super+ctrl+n"], "command": "create_file_from_template" }

If you are using Vintage mode and want to use sequences of non-modifier keys,
you can restrict the key bindings to command mode like this:

    { "keys": [" ", "n"], "command": "create_file_from_template", "context": [{"key": "setting.command_mode"}] }


## Thanks

This Package was forked from [SublimeQuickFileCreator](https://github.com/noklesta/SublimeQuickFileCreator) because it provided the best base for my needs and a good starting point to learn from :)
